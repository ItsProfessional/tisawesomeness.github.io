<h1>Minecraft Snapshot Reverse Engineering</h1>
This is where I post my findings from looking at the source code for every new Minecraft snapshot. You can usually expect a post within 1-2 days of the snapshot releasing.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
  I will not try to reverse engineer features that will change a lot, such as ore distribution. If you want me to cover a specific feature or find out how something works, DM me on Discord at <code>@tis_awesomeness</code>.
</p>
<p>
  I will be adding posts for earlier snapshots until all of them are finished, so check back every once in a while for new posts.
</p>

<h2>How can I do this?</h2>
Download <a href="https://github.com/hube12/DecompilerMC">DecompilerMC</a> and run <code>python main.py -c -mcv snap -s server</code> to decompile and map the latest snapshot. Then open the source code in your favorite editor (I recommend IntelliJ) and start looking around.
