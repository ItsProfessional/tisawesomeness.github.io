This snapshot adds dripstone and azalea growth, as well as even more raw ore texture tweaks. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w16a).

# Dripstone Growth

Every time the game random ticks the starting block of a stalagtite or stalagmite, there is a **`1.1377778%` chance (about 1/88) that the dripstone will grow one layer.**  The change does not change no matter how long the stalagtite or stalagmite is. The details are described in the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w16a).

# Azalea Bonemeal

When an azalea or flowering azalea block is bonemealed, there is a **45% chance for the azalea to grow into a tree.**
