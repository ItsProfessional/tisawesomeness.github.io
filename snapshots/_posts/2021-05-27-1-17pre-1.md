The first 1.17 pre-release is out! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-17-pre-release-1).

# Surge Protector Advancement

The advancement will trigger if lightning stirkes within 30 blocks of a villager, doesn't hit the villager, and the strike doesn't set any blocks on fire.

# Glow Sign Colors

The list of text and outline colors for glow signs is now on the [wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sign#Text) (thanks [Pneuma01](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/UserProfile:Pneuma01) for adding it).
